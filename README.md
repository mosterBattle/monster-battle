# Monster Battle

## Description

This application is a react web app that allows the user to create monsters and battle with them against other monsters in an RPG, turn-based-style game.

## Motivation

As a group of gaming fanatics, we wanted a simple video game application that had an old-school 8-bit theme giving a little head-nod to vintage gaming consoles
